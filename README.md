# What's it about?
The article discussed what it is like to be a data engineer and how their days at work is like. I found this article interesting because the people mention concepts we have worked on in class. The team has daily team sync, different assigned roles, and etc. They also talk about the technology they use such as AWS, Azure, and Kafka. Their current project implements a data engineering service that integrates Google Analystics clickstream data. This allows them to listen to the flow of business and perform experiment to improve customer experience. 


## Comment
- Reads like a short article talking about daily schedule. Nothing insightful really to me but guess it is always good to know what the potential job will be like on a daily basis, and then make decision whether you choose this job or not. Personally, I would say I kind of like this schedule. (Xinyu Xie)
